# Buzz Explorer

Simple iOS app for reading device info from a [Neosensory Buzz](https://neosensory.com/), and controlling its motor vibrations. Mostly intended as an example for how to use my [BuzzBLE](https://github.com/chrisbartley/BuzzBLE) Swift package.

Tested on an iPhone XS running iOS 13.7 and an iPad Mini 4 running iOS 12.0. Will probably look terrible on a small iPhone screen.
